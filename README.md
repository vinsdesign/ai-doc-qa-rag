AI Document Q&amp;A (RAG) is a web app that lets users upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search the most relevant sections of the document and generate answers with citations (page/chunk references), making responses more reliable and verifiable.
